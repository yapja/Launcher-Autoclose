# Launcher-Autoclose

This script terminates launcher if the game under that launcher is closed (Ex. DotA2 = Steam)

# Usage

Open **processes.json** and add the games/launchers you want, click save, and run **autoclose.exe**
Note: You could automatically run the script on Windows boot by adding **autoclose.exe** and **processes.json** to *C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup*
